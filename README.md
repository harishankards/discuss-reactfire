# Discuss-reactfire

This is just a simple React.js app which gets input from the user and generates a post and stores it in firebase.

In case you still wanna see the demo of this little creepy app, here you go:
```
git clone "https://github.com/harishankards/discuss-reactfire"
cd discuss-reactfire/
npm start 
```

Now go check here: `localost:3000`

### Thanks
